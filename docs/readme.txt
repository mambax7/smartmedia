This module was made possible by the financial support of the Innus Nation (www.innuaitun.com) and Montreal's web developing firm InBox Solutions (www.inboxsolutions.net).

The SmartFactory would like to thank La Society Radio-Canada for their help with the database structure and the DHTML tabs on the user side. Radio-Canada allowed us to get inspired from their excellent Archive Section.

We would also like to thank Nelson Dumais, leader of the InnuAitun project and Christian Aubry, RISQ's coordonator for the InnuAitun project.
